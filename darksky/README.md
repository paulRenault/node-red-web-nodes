node-red-node-darksky
=====================

A <a href="http://nodered.org" target="_new">Node-RED</a> node that gets the
weather forecast from the Dark Sky weather API.

Pre-requisites
--------------

You will need an API key from  <a href="https://darksky.net/dev/" target="_blank">Dark Sky developer portal</a>.

This allows 1000 requests per day. The polling node makes a request every 5 minutes = 288 requests.

Install
-------

Run the following command in the root directory of your Node-RED install.
This is usually `~/.node-red`

        npm install node-red-node-darksky

Usage
-----

Two nodes that get the weather forecast from the Dark Sky weather API.

One node polls the Dark Sky api every 5 minutes, the other is triggered
to request weather forecast data when an input is received.

The user has the option of providing a date to the node instead of returning data for the next day.
The node will always prioritise the node settings if they are present.

The node is configured using a latitude and longitude set of coordinates, an
optional date/time combination, and a set of units with which to format the response.

These can be passed in as settings on the node, or as:

 - **msg.location.lat**, **msg.location.lon** and **msg.time** or **msg.payload**.

If using *msg.time* it should be a javascript Date object. If using *msg.payload*
it must be a string or number of milliseconds since 1970 (epoch time in mS.)

The node sets the following properties of **msg.payload**:

### Results

Both will return

  - **weather** - a single word representation of the current weather forecast.
  - **detail** - a more detailed explanation of what the weather is forecast to be.
  - **humidity** - a current humidity forecast in decimal (0-1).
  - **maxtemp** - the current forecast max temperature for the location in Fahrenheit.
  - **mintemp** - the current forecast minimum temperature for the location in Fahrenheit.
  - **windspeed** - the current forecast windspeed at the location in metres per second
  - **winddirection** - the current forecast wind direction for the location in degrees.
  - **lon** - the longitude of the location from which the forecast was sourced.
  - **lat** - the latitude of the location from which the forecast was sourced.
  - **clouds** - the current forecast cloud coverage of the location in percent.
  - **precipitation** - the current forecast precipitation chance
  - **sunrise** - the time at which the is forecast to rise in Unix UTC format.
  - **sunset** - the time at which the sun is forecast to set in Unix UTC format.
  - **units** - the units of the returned data, as requested.

The node also sets the following properties of **msg.location**.

  - **lat** - the latitude of the location from which the data was sourced.
  - **lon** - the longitude of the location from which the data was sourced.
  - **city** - the city from which the data was sourced.
  - **country** - the country from which the data was sourced.

Finally, the node sets:

  - **msg.time** - the time at which the weather data was received by Dark Sky.
  - **msg.data** - the full JSON returned by the API. This is VERY rich...
